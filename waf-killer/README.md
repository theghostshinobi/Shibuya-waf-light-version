## 🚀 Overview

**WAF KILLER** is a revolutionary, high-performance Web Application Firewall (WAF) designed for the modern era. Built with the uncompromising security and performance of **Rust**, it combines traditional rule-based detection with cutting-edge Machine Learning and kernel-level eBPF filtering to provide ultimate protection for your web applications.

Unlike legacy WAFs that introduce significant latency, WAF KILLER is engineered for speed, delivering sub-millisecond overhead even under extreme load. It's not just a firewall; it's a developer-first security platform that fits seamlessly into your CI/CD pipelines and cloud-native environments.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 Core Detection Stack
- **Next-Gen CRS Engine**: Leveraging Coraza for hardened ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) compatibility.
- **ML Classifier**: Real-time traffic analysis using ONNX Runtime to detect zero-day anomalies.
- **Threat Intelligence**: Dynamic IP reputation scoring integrated with AbuseIPDB, AlienVault, and more.
- **GeoIP Awareness**: Granular control based on geographical source of traffic.

### 🛠️ Developer Experience
- **Elegant CLI**: A powerful, colored CLI for management, policy testing, and real-time monitoring.
- **Policy-as-Code**: YAML-defined security policies that live in your Git repositories.
- **Management Dashboard**: A stunning SvelteKit-powered UI with real-time WebSocket updates and interactive charts.

### ⚡ Performance & Extensibility
- **eBPF Filtering**: Kernel-level protection using XDP/TC-BPF for high-speed packet drops.
- **WASM Plugin System**: Extend detection logic using any language that compiles to WebAssembly.
- **Zero-Copy Architecture**: Minimized memory overhead and maximized throughput (<1ms overhead).
