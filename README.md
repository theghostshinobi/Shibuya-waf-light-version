## Introduction

### What is SHIBUYA WAF

SHIBUYA is a high-performance, open-source Web Application Firewall (WAF) written in Rust. It functions as a reverse proxy between the Internet and your backend server, analyzing every HTTP request in real-time to block cyber attacks before they reach your application.

### Purpose

SHIBUYA protects web applications from:

| Threat | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| SQL Injection | Attempts to manipulate database queries |
| Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) | Injection of malicious JavaScript code |
| Remote Code Execution (RCE) | Execution of commands on the server |
| Local File Inclusion (LFI) | Unauthorized access to system files |
| SSRF | Attacks exploiting the server to reach internal resources |
| Malicious Bots | Scraping, brute force, credential stuffing |
| Application-layer DDoS | Server overload with excessive requests |

### Architecture

```
Internet → SHIBUYA WAF (analysis + blocking) → Backend App
                    ↓
              Dashboard (monitoring)
```

SHIBUYA operates on 5 security layers:

1. **OWASP CRS Rules** — 614 pattern matching rules
2. **ML Anomaly Detection** — IsolationForest for unknown threats
3. **ML Classification** — SVM that categorizes attack types
4. **Threat Intelligence** — IP reputation from external feeds
5. **Bot Detection** — TLS fingerprinting and behavioral analysis

### Target Audience

- Developers who want to protect their applications
- DevOps/SRE teams managing web infrastructures
- Security teams requiring a configurable WAF
- Startups and SMEs seeking an open-source alternative to Cloudflare WAF

## Feature Guides

### Quick Setup — Protection in 30 Seconds

Quick Setup is the fastest way to activate WAF protection. No manual configuration required.

#### How to Use

**Step 1 — Enter Backend URL**

Enter your application URL (e.g., http://localhost:3000). You can also click on one of the framework presets to auto-fill:

| Preset | Auto-filled URL | Suggested Level |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| Next.js | http://localhost:3000 | Moderate |
| Vite/React | http://localhost:5173 | Moderate |
| Django | http://localhost:8000 | Strict |
| Flask | http://localhost:5000 | Moderate |
| Express | http://localhost:3000 | Moderate |
| Laravel | http://localhost:8000 | Strict |
| Rails | http://localhost:3000 | Moderate |
| Go | http://localhost:8080 | Permissive |

A green checkmark confirms the URL is valid.

**Step 2 — Choose Security Level**

| Level | Anomaly Threshold | Paranoia | Description |
|-------|------------------|----------|-------------|
| Strict | T=3 | PL3 | Maximum protection. May block legitimate edge-cases. Ideal for banking and healthcare apps. |
| Moderate ⭐ | T=5 | PL1 | Balanced. Blocks real attacks with few false positives. Recommended for most cases. |
| Permissive | T=10 | PL1 | Minimal friction. Blocks only obvious attacks. Ideal for high-traffic public APIs. |

**Step 3 — Click "Activate Protection"**

The system:
- Validates the URL (checks format and blocks SSRF)
- Tests connectivity to backend (5s timeout)
- Updates WAF configuration in real-time (hot-reload, zero restart)
- Shows success screen with WAF URL and curl test commands

**TIP:** After activation, all traffic to http://localhost:8080 will be proxied and automatically protected.

    healthy_threshold: 2               # Successful checks before marking "healthy"
```

### detection Section — Detection Engine

```yaml
detection:
  enabled: true                # Enable detection engine
  mode: blocking               # blocking | shadow (log only) | disabled
  crs:
    enabled: true              # Enable OWASP CRS rules
    rules_path: rules/crs      # Rules file path
    paranoia_level: 1          # 1=conservative, 2=medium, 3=aggressive, 4=paranoid
